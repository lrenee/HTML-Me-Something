            <h1>Ren&#233;e's Top Five Travel Experiences</h1>
            <p>I have been blessed to be able to travel to some of my bucket list places around the world, and have had some fabulous experiences while doing so...</p>
            <p>Although it is very challenging to choose, the following are my five favorite destinations (so far)...</p>
            <ol reversed>
                <li class="hotSpots"><a href="#Kauai">Kauai - The Na Pali Coast</a></li>
                <li class="hotSpots"><a href="#Maldives">Maldives - Overwater Bungalow</a></li>
                <li class="hotSpots"><a href="#GrandCanyon">Grand Canyon - White Water Rafting</a></li>
                <li class="hotSpots"><a href="#Egypt">Egypt - Nile River Cruise</a></li>
                <li class="hotSpots"><a href="#Kenya">Kenya - Safari</a></li>
            </ol>
            <p>Also hard to choose are the photos and anecdotes.  Hopefully, these accurately convey the vibe, while doing justice to each locale...</p>

                <li class="hotSpt">Kauai - The Na Pali Coast</li>
                <p>Hiking the Na Pali Coast in Kauai was quite the experience!  I have never been so afraid that someone I loved might actually die.  My husband, Mark, decided to drink only water on the hike, and ended up getting severely dehydrated.  (He was literally frothing at his calves!)  There is no place to stop along the way, so the choice was either to carry on or go back.  I am very thankful to say that we both made it out alive!  Lesson learned - drink lots of electrolytes!!!</p>

                <p>I think this experience is so high on my list because of the trials we went through, and the thrill of surviving them!  (I'm pretty sure that this experience is not one of Mark's favorites, though.  Understandably!)</p>

                <a name="Maldives"></a>
                <li class="hotSpt">Maldives - Overwater Bungalow</li>
                <p>Mark and I spent our ten-year wedding anniversary in the Maldives.  What a beautiful place for some much needed rest and relaxation!!!</p>

                <a name="GrandCanyon"></a>
                <li class="hotSpt">Grand Canyon - White Water Rafting</li>
                <p>We were very fortunate to be able to white water raft the Grand Canyon.  What an amazing place!!!</p>

                <p>I bet you can only imagine the bathrooms - a bucket with a toilet seat called the Groover, for the ridges the buckets used to leave behind.  I'll leave that one to your imagination.  (You can thank me later...)</p>

                <a name="Egypt"></a>
                <li class="hotSpt">Egypt - Nile River Cruise</li>
                <p>Mark and I went to Egypt during the Arab Spring uprising.  So, tourism was down, and that meant we had some amazing photo opportunities!!!</p>

                <p>Egypt seemed so far away and so culturally different, but the local people we met while we were there were not so different from us.  That fact tends to prove true wherever we go, and it is one of the main reasons I am so passionate about traveling!</p>

                    <li class="hotSpt">Kenya - Safari</li>
                    <p>Finally, my favorite trip so far is our African Safari.  Kenya just felt like another world, with breathtaking views and amazing wildlife!!!</p>

                    <p>The trip made me aware of the conservation efforts going on in the area.  The Sheldrick Wildlife Trust is, in my opinion, an organization worthy of ongoing financial support.  Please follow the link below to learn more, and please consider making a contribution:</p>

                    <p>The highlight of the entire trip was visiting the Sheldrick elephant orphanage in Nairobi National Park.  Elephants are truly amazing creatures, and orphaned baby elephants are heartbreakingly adorable.  The orphanage does some amazing work around rescuing and raising these fantastic beasts!</p>
